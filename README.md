<h1 align="center">skalo</h1>


### Overview

skalo is a graph-based algorithm designed to infer variants from WGS outbreak data. It takes as input multi-samples split k-mer files generated by SKA, so inherits the computational efficiency of the SKA algorithm which generates these. Please note that at the moment only SNPs are inferred. 


### Installation
you can download this repository and, once inside the downloaded directory, compile skalo with cargo:
```
cargo build --release
```
skalo will be located in the directory target/release/.


### Running skalo
To infer SNPs from a skf file:
```
skalo -i my_file.skf
```
To infer SNPs from a skf file and map them on a reference genome:
```
skalo -i my_file.skf -r reference_genome.fas -m 0.4
```
